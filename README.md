cadence virtuoso exp by lbrce student
 or gate using cmos technology in Cadence Virtuoso. The project involved using various Cadence software backend tools with 90nm technology.
The tools utilized include:
Virtuoso Schematic Editor and Virtuoso Layout Editor for initial design stages.
Spectre for simulation.
Assura for verification.
The process included schematic creation, pre-layout simulations, layout design, Design Rule Checks (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification, RC extraction (RCX), and post-layout simulations.
The final step was generating the GDSII file for the completed design.
